# MahApps.Metro.Mvvm
A Cookbook of MVVM-oriented Solutions to Common MahApps.Metro Problems

# Background 
[MahApss.Metro](http://mahapps.com/) is an open-source project that brings Metro-style to your WPF applications.

The primary contributors of MA.M have stated that the library [is not opinionated](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/999) about a user's backend implementation (MVVM, MVC, direct code-behind). This offers a lot of flexibility and makes it straightforward to get started with MA.M. However, there are nuances to more advanced UI topics that would benefit from a clear preference towards Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM).

MVVM is [one of the preferred](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx#id0090016) ways of designing WPF applications but doing it correctly is clearly a challenge. This project will serve as a resource for best-practices when combining MA.M with MVVM.
